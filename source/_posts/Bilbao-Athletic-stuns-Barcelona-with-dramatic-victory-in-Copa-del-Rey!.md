#  Bilbao Athletic stuns Barcelona with dramatic victory in Copa del Rey!

In one of the biggest shocks in the history of the Copa del Rey, Bilbao Athletic pulled off a dramatic victory over Barcelona on Wednesday night. The 3-2 upset was complete when Aymeric Laporte scored in the 88th minute to send the home supporters into delirium.

Barcelona had started brightly and taken the lead through Lionel Messi in the 21st minute, but Athletic Bilbao hit back with two goals in quick succession from Aritz Aduriz and Iker Muniain. Neymar equalized for Barcelona early in the second half, but it was not enough as Laporte’s late winner sent the Bilbao fans into raptures.

This was only Athletic Bilbao’s second victory over Barcelona in their last 29 meetings, and it is a result which will live long in the memory of everyone associated with the club. Ernesto Valverde will be especially delighted, as he left Athletic Bilbao to take over at Barcelona last summer.

There were some worrying scenes after the final whistle as some of the Barcelona players appeared to confront Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz, but thankfully things did not get out of hand. The visitors had looked likely to add to their record haul of Copa Del Rey trophies, but they were stunned by a spirited Athletic Bilbao side on a memorable night at San Mames.

#  Athletic Bilbao become first team to ever beat Barcelona at the Nou Camp!

Athletic Bilbao pulled off an historic victory over Barcelona at the Nou Camp on Saturday night, becoming the first team ever to win there.

The home side had not lost at their famous stadium in all competitions since Pep Guardiola took charge in 2008, but they were comprehensively beaten by Athletic who fully deserved their three points.

Roberto Martinez's side opened the scoring in the first half when Fernando Llorente finished from close range after some excellent work from Iker Muniain.

And they sealed the win late on when Ander Herrera fired into the top corner from just inside the penalty area.

The result means that Barcelona have now dropped six points from their opening three Liga games, while Athletic move up to second in the table.

#  Neymar scores as Barcelona edge Bilbao Athletic in Copa clash 

Neymar bagged his eleventh goal of the season as Barcelona edged Bilbao Athletic in the Copa Del Rey clash on Wednesday night. Luis Suarez had given the Catalans the lead in the first half, but Aritz Aduriz netted a late equaliser to make it 1-1 and take the game into extra-time. Neymar then struck in the 105th minute to win it for Barcelona and set up a last 16 tie against Levante.

The Brazil international has been in superb form this season and is already well on course to having his best campaign yet at Camp Nou. He has now scored more than 20 goals in all competitions for the sixth successive season, underlining his importance to Barcelona. And with Lionel Messi currently sidelined with a calf injury, Neymar will be even more crucial for the Blaugrana as they look to win silverware this season.

Barca were not at their best against Athletic Bilbao, but they did just enough to get the job done and progress to the next round of the Copa Del Rey. Ernesto Valverde will be pleased with his side's resilience and determination, especially given that they are without their talisman Messi at the moment. There are still some concerns over their defence however, with Gerard Pique looking particularly shaky at times.

Levante will provide a very tough test for Barcelona in the last 16 of the Copa Del Rey, but Neymar and co should be confident of progressing to the next stage. With Messi expected back soon, Barca have every chance of winning this year's competition and lifting some silverware at last.

#  Super Leo Messi leads Barcelona's comeback against Bilbao Athletic

 Leo Messi led Barcelona's impressive comeback against Bilbao Athletic in the Copa del Rey on Thursday night. Trailing 2-1 from the away leg, Barca found themselves behind once again at the Camp Nou when Athletic took an early lead. However, a Messi hat-trick turned the game around and sent the Catalan side through to the quarterfinals.

The Argentina international has now scored in each of his last nine home games in all competitions, and he is well on course to break his own club record of scoring in 21 consecutive matches at the Camp Nou. His latest treble took his tally for the season to 28 goals in all competitions, and he is sure to be a major factor in Barcelona's push for silverware this season.

With Luis Suarez sidelined with a knee injury and Neymar moving to PSG in the summer, Messi will be even more important to Barca this season. And if he can continue to show this kind of form, there is no doubt that they can challenge for La Liga and Champions League glory.

#  Crucial away goal for Athletic Bilbao against Barcelona in Copa del Rey

The first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinal between Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona ended in a 1-1 draw. This means that the second leg, which will take place at the Camp Nou, is absolutely crucial for Athletic Bilbao if they want to reach the final.

Athletic Bilbao will have to score an away goal if they want to have any chance of winning the tie, and they will also need to keep Barcelona at bay, as the Catalan club are known for being deadly in front of goal.

Barcelona were without Lionel Messi in the first leg, but he is set to return for the second leg, and this will give them a major boost as they look to reach their first final of the season.

Athletic Bilbao have been in excellent form in recent weeks, and they will be looking to cause an upset by knocking Barcelona out of the Copa del Rey.

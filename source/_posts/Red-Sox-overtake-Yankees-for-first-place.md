#  Red Sox overtake Yankees for first place

For the first time this season, the Boston Red Sox are in first place in the American League East. They overtook the New York Yankees over the weekend, thanks to a three-game sweep of their rivals.

Boston got off to a slow start this year, but they have been on a roll lately. They have won seven of their last eight games, and they seem to be hitting their stride at just the right time.

The Red Sox are led by their slugging outfielder, Mookie Betts. Betts is having an MVP-caliber season, and he is currently leading the majors in batting average and on-base percentage. He is also among the leaders in slugging percentage and OPS.

Betts has been helped by fellow outfielder J.D. Martinez, who was acquired in an offseason trade with the Detroit Tigers. Martinez has been a force in the middle of the lineup, driving in runs and hitting home runs.

The pitching staff has also been solid for Boston this year. Chris Sale leads the way as one of the best pitchers in baseball. He is 9-4 with a 2.36 ERA and 137 strikeouts in 123 innings pitched. Rick Porcello and David Price have also been solid this year, and Eduardo Rodriguez has shown flashes of potential as well.

The Red Sox will now try to hold on to first place for the remainder of the season. They have a tough schedule ahead, with series against the Houston Astros, Cleveland Indians, and Los Angeles Dodgers coming up soon. But if they can continue to play like they have been lately, they should be able to stay ahead of the pack.

#  Tough loss for Yankees as they fall to Red Sox

The New York Yankees were looking to inch closer to the Boston Red Sox in the AL East standings, but they came up short on Monday night.

New York was shut out by Boston starter David Price, while the Red Sox got homers from J.D. Martinez and Mookie Betts in a 4-0 victory.

Yankees starter Luis Severino allowed all four runs over six innings, and Giancarlo Stanton went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts as New York lost for just the third time in its last 12 games.

Boston is now six games ahead of New York in the AL East standings.

#  Orioles making a move for the playoffs

The Baltimore Orioles have been one of the most surprising teams in baseball this year. They currently sit in second place in the American League East, just four games back of the Boston Red Sox.

Despite their success, the Orioles know that they will need to make some moves if they want to make the playoffs this year. One of their biggest needs is a starting pitcher.

There are a few pitchers who could be available at the trade deadline. The Orioles could go after Matt Harvey of the New York Mets, Cole Hamels of the Texas Rangers, or Marcus Stroman of the Toronto Blue Jays.

Harvey would be the most expensive option, but he could be a difference maker for the Orioles. Hamels is a proven veteran who could help lead Baltimore to the playoffs. Stroman is still young and has a lot of upside. He could be a future ace for the Orioles.

If the Orioles can't get one of those pitchers, they may look to add another bat to their lineup. Jay Bruce of the Mets or Marcell Ozuna of the Miami Marlins could be good options.

The Orioles have proved that they are a team to watch this year. If they can make some key acquisitions at the trade deadline, they could be headed to the playoffs for the first time since 1997.

#  Blue Jays look to climb back up the standings

The Toronto Blue Jays have not had the best start to the season. They currently sit in last place in the AL East with a record of 9-17. However, they are only 5.5 games out of first place and there is plenty of time for them to make a comeback.

The Blue Jays have some good players on their team, including Josh Donaldson, José Bautista, and Edwin Encarnación. They also have some talented young players, such as Aaron Sanchez and Devon Travis.

One reason for the Blue Jays' slow start may be that they are playing in one of the toughest divisions in baseball. The AL East features four teams (Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, and Tampa Bay Rays) that all have winning records so far this season.

The Blue Jays will need to play better if they want to climb back up the standings. They will need to improve their batting average and their bullpen must perform better if they want to make a run at the playoffs.

The Blue Jays face a tough challenge over the next few weeks as they will have to play several teams that are currently in first place, including the Yankees and the Red Sox. However, if they can get hot at the right time, they could still make a run at the playoffs.

#  Rays fall further behind in the AL East

The Tampa Bay Rays (54-59) continue to struggle, losing their most recent game against the Boston Red Sox (71-44) by a score of 7-1. This latest loss drops the Rays further behind in the AL East, as they are now 8.5 games out of first place.

The Rays were held to just four hits in the game, with Carlos Gomez and Daniel Robertson both registering two hits. Gomez also drove in the team's only run with a solo home run in the fourth inning.

Meanwhile, Red Sox pitcher Rick Porcello was dominant, allowing just one run on four hits over seven innings of work. Xander Bogaerts and Mookie Betts both went deep for Boston, helping to put the game out of reach.

With just 27 games remaining in the regular season, it is looking increasingly likely that the Rays will miss out on the playoffs for the third consecutive year.

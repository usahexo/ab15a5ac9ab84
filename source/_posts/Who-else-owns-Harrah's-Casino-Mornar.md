#  Who else owns Harrah's Casino Mornar?

In June 2013, Harrah's Casino Mornar was sold to Novi Investment a.d., a company registered in Montenegro. The selling price was not disclosed, but it is rumored to be in the region of €10 million.

This sale is the latest in a long line of ownership changes for the casino. It has been owned by a number of different companies over the years, including Novomatic AG, which is one of Austria's largest gaming corporations.

So, who exactly is Novi Investment a.d.? And why did they decide to purchase Harrah's Casino Mornar?

Novi Investment a.d. is a relatively new company, having been founded in 2012. It is majority-owned by two individuals: Nikola Grbesa and Goran Vasiljevic. Both men are Montenegrin entrepreneurs with a wealth of business experience.

The company's main focus is real estate investment, and it has already made a number of high-profile purchases in Montenegro. These include the hotels Imperial and Splendid, as well as Marbella Plaza - one of the most exclusive shopping centres in Podgorica (Montenegro's capital city).

Why did Novi Investment a.d. purchase Harrah's Casino Mornar? There are a few possible explanations:

1) The casino is considered to be a valuable asset due to its prime location on the beachfront. It could be seen as an attractive investment opportunity for Novi Investment a.d.'s real estate portfolio.
2) The company may plan to expand the casino's operations and make it into a leading tourist attraction in Montenegro. This could be good news for local residents and businesses, as it would bring more tourists to the country.
3) There could also be plans to redevelop the casino complex, which would involve extensive renovation work and could create jobs for locals.
Whatever the reason for the purchase, it will be interesting to see what Novi Investment a.d.'s plans are for Harrah's Casino Mornar and how it will impact Montenegro's tourism industry

#  How does the company ownership affect casino operations there?

There is a great deal of debate when it comes to the impact that company ownership has on casino operations. Some people argue that the type of company which owns a casino can have a significant impact on how the casino is run, while others believe that the company’s ownership has little impact on casino proceedings. This article will explore both sides of the argument and seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of how company ownership affects casino operations.

One of the most commonly cited examples in support of the idea that company ownership impacts casino operations is Sheldon Adelson’s purchase of the Sands Casino in Las Vegas. Adelson is known for being a conservative businessman who is highly critical of gambling, and many experts argue that this has had a negative impact on the Sands Casino. For instance, Adelson has made it difficult for gamblers to redeem their rewards points, and he has also put in place strict rules regarding what games can be played at his casino. In contrast, Phil Ivey, one of the world’s most successful professional poker players, has an ownership stake in several casinos, and he is known for being much more player-friendly. Ivey allows players to cash in their rewards points more easily and he also permits them to play a wider variety of games.

While there are certainly cases where company ownership does have a clear impact on casino operations, it is important to remember that there are also many examples where this isn’t necessarily true. For instance, Caesars Entertainment Corporation is a major player in both the United States and international gambling markets, but it is currently owned by Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital- two private equity firms. This hasn’t had any noticeable negative effects on Caesars Entertainment Corporation’s casinos, as they continue to make money hand over fist.

So what conclusion can be drawn from all this? Ultimately, it seems that company ownership does have some impact on casino operations, but this impact isn’t always clear-cut or easy to measure. What matters more than who owns a casino is how well that casino is run- and this can vary from property to property.

#  What changes, if any, will be made to the casino now that it is privately held?

When the casino first opened in 2004, it was hailed as a sign of progress for the town. The casino was a major employer, and it generated much-needed revenue for the town's coffers.

Now that the casino is privately held, there may be some changes to how it is run. The new owner may decide to close the casino down or sell it off to another company. If that happens, the town would lose a major employer and a source of revenue.

The new owner may also decide to keep the casino open and run it as a for-profit business. In that case, the employees may see their wages reduced and the prices for services and goods offered at the casino may increase.

So far, there has been no announcement from the new owner about what changes, if any, will be made to the casino. We will have to wait and see what happens in the coming months.

#  Are there any plans to sell the property in the near future?

It's hard to say. The owners have not given any indication of their plans, but they are getting older and may want to sell the property while they are still able to enjoy the proceeds.

#  How do local authorities feel about the change in ownership?

Councils and other local authorities are not unanimous in their views of the sale of High Speed 1 to a consortium comprising funds managed by InfraRed Capital Partners and Equitix. Some feel that it is good news for the taxpayer, as it secures the long-term future of the line and will bring in additional revenues. Others, however, are concerned about the impact on services that rely on HS1, such as Thameslink and Southern rail. There is particular concern about what will happen to Crossrail if there are significant delays in upgrading HS1.

# What impact could the change in ownership have on passengers?

Passengers are likely to see an improvement in service, as the new owners have promised to invest £300 million in upgrades. This will include lengthening trains from eight to 12 coaches, increasing capacity by 50%. There are also plans to improve the booking experience and provide more information about delays and disruptions.

The consortium has also promised not to increase ticket prices for the next five years. After that, prices will be increased in line with inflation. This is good news for passengers, who have seen fares increase much faster than inflation in recent years.

# What does this mean for Brexit?

It is not yet clear what effect the change in ownership will have on Brexit. The new owners are keen to stress their commitment to keeping Britain open for business, but it is possible that they may want to renegotiate some of the terms of the deal. This could add further complications to an already complex process.

#  Epiphone Casino Aurora Goes from Beast to Hunter with New Pickups

The Epiphone Casino Aurora is a popular guitar that has been around for a while. It's known for its semi-hollow body construction and its versatile sound. However, the original pickups in the Casino Aurora left something to be desired. They were a bit too bright and harsh sounding for some players' taste.

Fortunately, Epiphone has now addressed this issue with the release of new pickups for the Casino Aurora. The new pickups are based on those found in their top-of-the-line models, and they provide a warmer, hollower tone that is perfect for jazz, blues, and rock 'n' roll.

So if you're looking for an affordable way to get that classic Epiphone sound, the Casino Aurora with the new pickups is definitely worth checking out.

#  Amazing Pickup Change Turns Epiphone Casino Aurora into Hunter Beast!

If you're like me, and have an addiction to guitars, then you know that Epiphone Casino's are some of the best around. Affordable and versatile, they can be made to sound amazing with just a few simple changes.

I was recently looking for a new guitar to buy, and I came across an Epiphone Casino Aurora. It's a beautiful guitar, but it just didn't feel right in my hands. So I decided to do a little pickup change and turn it into the beast that I knew it could be!

The first step was to remove the existing pickups. This is a very simple process, and can be done with just a screwdriver. Once the pickups are out, take a look at them and decide which type of pickup you want to use.

I decided to go with a set of Seymour Duncan '59 humbuckers. They're perfect for bringing out the natural tone of the guitar, and they really beef up the sound when compared to the stock pickups.

Once you've chosen your pickups, it's time to start installing them. This can also be done with just a screwdriver, and it's a fairly simple process. Just make sure that you follow the wiring diagram that comes with your pickups, so that you don't accidentally damage anything.

Once everything is installed, it's time to test out your new setup! Put on your favorite album or plug into your favorite amp, and let rip! You'll be amazed at how much better your guitar sounds now that it's been transformed into a Hunter beast!

#  Pickup Change Makes Epiphone Casino Aurora Beastly

The pickups in an Epiphone Casino are quite different than those in a Gibson ES-335, which can make them sound quite beastly. The neck pickup is hotter than the one in the ES-335, and the bridge pickup is brighter. This can be a great combination for rock and blues players who want a little more edge to their sound.

Some people have actually replaced the pickups in their Casino with those from an ES-335 in order to get a tone that is closer to that of a Gibson. While this does work, it’s not really necessary, since the Casino already has such a great sound. In fact, many professional guitar players prefer the sound of an Epiphone Casino over that of a Gibson ES-335.

The bottom line is that if you’re looking for a guitar with a powerful sound that can handle anything from rock to blues, an Epiphone Casino is definitely worth checking out.

#  What are the Rules of the Grand LIVE Roulette Game?

There are a number of important rules that players need to be aware of when playing the Grand LIVE Roulette game. One of the most important is that players must place their bets before the ball begins spinning. This means that they cannot wait until the last minute to make a decision on what bet they want to place.

Players also need to be aware that they are not allowed to touch the roulette wheel or ball. They also cannot place their hand inside the betting area. Touching these objects can result in a player being penalized or even ejected from the game.

Finally, players need to remember that Roulette is a game of chance and there is no guarantee that they will win every time they play. It is important to have realistic expectations and not gamble more money than they can afford to lose.

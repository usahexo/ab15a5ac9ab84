#  Gran Turismo 7 Updates: New Casino Content & Roulette Tickets

# PlayStation 4 racing game offers new content in the form of a casino and roulette tickets

Ahead of the game’s release on November 15th, developers Polyphony Digital have announced that Gran Turismo 7 will feature a casino DLC update. The casino content includes 500 new log-in bonuses, 10 new PS4 trophies, and a “brand-new game mode” that has yet to be revealed.

While fans are eagerly awaiting news about what this new game mode could be, details about the other in-game rewards have started to surface. These include tickets which can be used to play a game of roulette in the casino. There are three different colors of tickets – each with their own payout values – and players will receive one ticket every time they level up their driver profile.

Roulette is a popular casino game that involves players betting on where they think the ball will land after spinning around a wheel with 37 numbered slots plus a 0 and 00 slot. In Gran Turismo 7, the aim is to correctly predict whether the ball will stop on an odd or even number, or one of six colors (red, black, green, yellow, blue or pink). Winnings are based on how much money has been bet, with different payouts for each color ticket.

For those who are unfamiliar with how to play roulette, Polyphony Digital have released a short guide which covers the basics. This includes understanding the different types of bets that can be made, as well as advice on when to quit if your original bet doesn’t seem as if it’s going to win.

In addition to the casino DLC update, Gran Turismo 7 will also feature additional cars including several that were announced as part of Toyota’s “100 Year Heritage” campaign. These include vehicles such as the Toyota 2000GT and Supra MkIV which were both featured in previous Gran Turismo games.

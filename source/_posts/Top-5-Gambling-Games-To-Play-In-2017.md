#  Casino Gamblers Favor Slot Machines Over Other Games

Slot machines are the most popular type of casino game among gamblers, with almost two-thirds of all casino patrons playing slots. The games are simple to play and often offer relatively big payouts.

Blackjack is the second most popular game, with just over a third of all casino goers playing the card game. Roulette is a distant third, with around one-fifth of all casino players giving the wheel a spin.

Interestingly, there is no clear consensus on which game offers the best odds for players. Blackjack has an edge for the player of less than 1 percent in most cases, while slot machines have an edge of around 10 percent. However, blackjack can be more complicated to play, so some people may prefer the simpler gameplay of slots.

Roulette also has better odds for players than slot machines, but its popularity may be waning due to its high house edge. Casino operators may want to consider adding more slot machines to their floors if they want to appeal to today's gamblers.

#   slot machines dominate gambling industry

Slot machines account for more than two-thirds of the gambling industry’s revenue, according to a study by the research firm Macquarie Group.

The betting market is worth about $450bn, but slot machines bring in 68% of the total revenue – or about $310bn.

Conventional casino games, such as roulette and blackjack, make up just 31% of industry earnings.

Las Vegas is the largest gambling market in the world, with revenues of almost $25bn last year.

Macau, the only place in China where casinos are legal, is second with revenues of almost $35bn.

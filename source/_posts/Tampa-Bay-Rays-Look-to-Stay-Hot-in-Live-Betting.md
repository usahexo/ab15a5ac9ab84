#  Tampa Bay Rays Look to Stay Hot in Live Betting

The Tampa Bay Rays have been one of the best teams in baseball this season, as they currently boast a 71-44 record. This has led to them being one of the most popular teams to bet on in live betting, as their odds of winning continue to be high.

Despite their strong play, the Rays have been involved in some close games recently. On August 8th, they narrowly defeated the Toronto Blue Jays by a score of 2-1. They followed that up with a 6-5 victory over the Detroit Tigers on August 9th.

The Rays will look to stay hot in live betting when they take on the Baltimore Orioles on August 10th. The Orioles have had a disappointing season, as they currently have a 47-73 record. The Rays are currently listed as -190 favorites to win this game, and they are expected to prevail by a margin of 3.5 runs.

Tampa Bay will then take on the Boston Red Sox on August 11th. The Red Sox currently have the best record in baseball, as they boast a 93-39 record. Despite this, the Rays are still listed as +130 underdogs in this game. This is likely due to the fact that Boston has won seven of their last ten meetings against Tampa Bay.

The Rays will conclude their road trip with a matchup against the New York Yankees on August 12th. The Yankees are currently leading the American League East division with a 91-40 record. As a result, the Rays are listed as massive +375 underdogs in this game.

#  Rays Look for Sixth Straight Win in Live Betting Action

There’s something about baseball that just makes it a perfect sport for live betting. The action is constant, there are countless opportunities for in-game wagers, and the games tend to be relatively high scoring, which means big payouts for those who hit their picks.

The Rays continue to be one of the most popular teams to bet on in live action, and they come into their game against the Blue Jays on Tuesday with a 5-game winning streak. Tampa Bay is a -154 favorite at home, and they should have little trouble extending their streak against a Toronto team that has lost 7 of its last 10 games.

The Blue Jays offer plenty of value as an underdog though, and those looking to take a chance on them could see some nice profits. Toronto is currently paying out +138 at most sportsbooks, and they have the potential to pull off an upset if they can get some early runs on the board.

Of course, there are plenty of other matchups worth betting on tonight. The Dodgers opened as a -183 favorite over the Brewers, but that line has since shifted to -200 or higher at most sportsbooks. Milwaukee has been hot lately though, so it might be worth taking them at those odds. The Cubs are also in action against the Marlins, and they are currently favored by -235 at most sportsbooks. Chicago should win easily, but there’s no need to risk too much money on them given their high price tag.

There are plenty of great options for in-game betting tonight, so make sure to check out all the latest lines before placing your bets. With so much action available, you’re sure to find something that catches your eye!

#  Can Tampa Bay Rays Extend Their Winning Streak in Live Betting?

The Tampa Bay Rays will be looking to extend their winning streak when they take on the Boston Red Sox in a three-game series at Fenway Park. The Rays have been on a hot streak, winning 8 of their last 10 games and are now just 2 games behind the first-place Red Sox in the American League East Division.

Boston is a 3.5-point favorite in the opening matchup of the series on Friday, but the Rays could be a good value bet as an underdog. Tampa Bay has been one of the best teams in baseball against the spread this season with a record of 38-27-4. They have also been one of the best teams in MLB in terms of betting odds when playing as an underdog, going 16-9-3 this year.

The Rays will send left-hander Blake Snell (12-5, 2.27 ERA) to the mound for Friday’s game, while the Red Sox will counter with righty Rick Porcello (17-7, 4.28 ERA). Porcello has been having a strong season, but he has struggled in his past two starts, allowing 6 runs over 11 innings pitched. Snell has been one of the best pitchers in baseball this year and should be able to keep Boston’s offense at bay.

Tampa Bay is also a good value bet on Saturday when they are listed as a +130 underdog against Boston. Chris Archer (10-8, 4.07 ERA) will be taking the mound for the Rays and he has been pitching well lately, allowing 3 runs or fewer in six of his last seven starts. The Red Sox will counter with David Price (16-6, 3.44 ERA), who has also had a strong season but has not pitched as well lately, allowing 5 runs over his past two starts.

The final game of the series on Sunday is also worth betting on Tampa Bay as an underdog (+150). The Rays will send lefty Nathan Eovaldi (2-2, 3.72 ERA) to face off against Boston’s ace Chris Sale (13-5, 2.75 ERA). Sale has been one of the best pitchers in baseball this year, but he has had some trouble recently, allowing 9 runs over his past 13 innings pitched. Eovaldi is coming off his best start of the season where he tossed 7 shutout innings against the Seattle Mariners.

Tampa Bay is likely to extend their winning streak in live betting over these three games against Boston and could very well come out on top in this divisional matchup.

#  Tampa Bay Rays Eye Another Victory in Live Betting

The Tampa Bay Rays will be looking to make it two in a row when they take on the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night. The Rays were able to pick up a victory over the Blue Jays on Monday night, and they will be looking to do the same thing on Tuesday night.

Prior to the start of this series, the Tampa Bay Rays were listed as +120 underdogs at most sportsbooks. However, they have managed to win both games so far in this series, and now they are listed as -135 favorites at most sportsbooks. This includes the Betonline Sportsbook, where you can currently get a +105 price on Tampa Bay.

The Toronto Blue Jays are going to be a tough team to beat, but the Rays have been playing very well lately. They have won six of their last seven games overall, and they seem to be clicking on all cylinders right now.

#  Bolstered by Recent Wins, Tampa Bay Rays Look to Continue Momentum in Live Betting

The Tampa Bay Rays had a strong start to the season, but they were unable to sustain that momentum and fell in the standings. However, the Rays have been on a roll lately and have climbed their way back up the ladder. They are now in fifth place in the American League East and are just 4.5 games out of first.

There are several reasons for the Rays’ resurgence. One of the biggest factors has been their bullpen. In particular, Ryne Stanek and Diego Castillo have been standout pitchers out of the bullpen. Stanek has a 2.37 ERA and Castillo has a 2.63 ERA.

 Additionally, the offense has been more productive as of late. The team is batting .253 as a whole this season, but they are batting .269 over their last 10 games. This includes timely hitting by players such as Ji-Man Choi and Brandon Lowe.

The Rays will look to continue their momentum when they take on the Toronto Blue Jays in a three-game series starting on Monday night. The Blue Jays are not having a good season, so the Rays should be able to pick up some wins in this series. You can place bets on these games at online sportsbooks such as SportsBetting or Bovada.

#  Where is the God of War M Game?

The much anticipated God of War M game for mobile devices has yet to be released, and there is no word on when it will be. Fans of the series are eagerly waiting to get their hands on it, but there is little information available online about the game.

So far, all that is known about the game is that it will be released for iOS and Android devices. It is uncertain whether or not it will be a free-to-play game or if there will be a price tag attached to it. There has been no announcement about what platforms it will be released on either, so PC gamers may or may not get a chance to play it.

In terms of gameplay, it is expected that the game will follow the same format as previous entries in the series. Players will take control of Kratos as he hacks and slashes his way through hordes of enemies. There is also speculation that the development team may have included some elements from Naughty Dog's Uncharted series into the game, which would make for an interesting crossover.

So far, there has been no confirmation about any of this however, so gamers should take all rumours with a grain of salt. Hopefully, Sony will give us some more concrete information about the game in the near future so that we can start counting down the days until its release.

#  God of War M found!

A team of archaeologists from the University of Warsaw has announced the discovery of a new Greek god. The deity, which has been named "M," was found buried in an ancient shrine near Athens. M is thought to be the god of war, and may have been worshipped by the Spartans.

"This is a remarkable discovery," said Dr. Olga Kefala, head of the archaeological team. "M is a very rare deity, and we know very little about him."

M's shrine is remarkably well-preserved, and contains numerous artifacts that may shed light on the god's origins and worshipers. The shrine is also decorated with murals depicting scenes from M's life.

The discovery of M has generated considerable excitement among scholars of ancient Greece. "This could be a major breakthrough in our understanding of Greek religion," said Dr. Kefala. "M may have been an important god in his day, but we know very little about him. This find could help us learn more about his role in Greek society."

#  God of War M whereabouts revealed!

The game “God of War” is receiving a great deal of attention lately. There are some new spoilers being released that show the whereabouts of Kratos and reveals his son, Sora.

Some believe that the game will take place in Norse mythology. Fans have even been piecing together clues from the trailer that were previously hidden. This has included speculations about where different aspects of the trailer are set and who the characters are.

The newest spoilers for the game include a map that reveals where Kratos is currently living. The map points to a location in Norway. It is said that he has been living there with his son, Sora, who is training to become a god like his father.

There are also theories about which characters will be appearing in the game. Some believe that Thor may make an appearance, along with other popular Norse gods and goddesses. It is unclear whether Sora will have any fighting abilities or if he will simply be accompanying his father on his journey.

There is much excitement for the upcoming release of God of War and fans are anxious to see how everything plays out. The game is scheduled to be released sometime in early 2018 and it is sure to be a hit among gamers everywhere!

#  God of War M game located! Finally! 

Fans of the popular video game God of War were eagerly awaiting the release of its newest version, God of War M. The game was finally released this week and gamers around the world were rushing to purchase it.

However, just two days after its release, many copies of the game were found to be defective. In some cases, the game would not start at all, while in others it would crash in the middle of play.

Gamers were understandably upset, as they had been looking forward to playing the new game for months. Many took to social media to express their disappointment, while others demanded refunds from the retailers where they had purchased their copies of the game.

In response to the widespread defections, Sony issued a statement saying that they were working on a fix and that gamers could expect an update soon. They also offered players a free month of PlayStation Plus membership as compensation for the inconvenience.

The defective copies of God of War M have since been recalled and replaced with functioning copies. So if you are one of the lucky ones who managed to get your hands on a copy before they were recalled, then you are in for a treat!

#  The search for God of War M is finally over!

Sony Interactive Entertainment has just announced that the new instalment in the God of War series will be released in early 2018.

Kratos, the protagonist of the game, returns as the main character, and he is now a father who is trying to raise his son Atreus.

The game promises to be full of blood-soaked action, as well as puzzles and exploration, so it should be perfect for gamers who loved the first two games in the series.

In a blog post on the PlayStation website, Cory Barlog, creative director at Sony Santa Monica Studio, said: "We are happy to finally be able to share this news with you all. God of War III left a big scar on me - I hope we have made a game that pays tribute to how much fun we all had making it."

The game was first hinted at in 2016 by Barlog himself, when he posted a picture on Instagram that showed the words “God of War IV” crossed out and replaced with “God of War M”.

This new instalment will see Kratos leave behind his home in Mount Olympus and set sail for the world of Norse mythology. This means that gamers can expect to see characters such as Thor and Loki make an appearance.

The last God of War game was released in 2013, so gamers have been eagerly waiting for news about a new instalment for quite some time. In the meantime, they have been able to satisfy their needs with games such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Battlefield 1.

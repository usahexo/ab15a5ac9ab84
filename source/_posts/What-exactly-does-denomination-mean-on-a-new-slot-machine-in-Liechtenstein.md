#  What exactly does denomination mean on a new slot machine in Liechtenstein?

A Denomination is the name of a coin or note, especially in reference to its value. When you are playing a slot machine, and it asks for your denomination this is what is being asked for. In other words, how much money do you want to wager per spin. Most machines offer different denominations so that players of all budgets can enjoy playing them.

Typically, the denominations will range from $0.01 up to $5.00 or more. So if you want to play for lower stakes, choose a machine with smaller denominations, and if you're feeling lucky and want to bet more per spin, go for one with bigger denominations. Just be sure that the amount you choose is something you're comfortable with, as you don't want to get carried away and wind up spending more than you intended!
